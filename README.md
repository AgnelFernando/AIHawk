This project is forked from the [AIhawk](https://github.com/feder-cr/Jobs_Applier_AI_Agent_AIHawk/tree/main) repository.

Iâ€™ve added two additional features:

1. Generate a resume from a .txt file

2. Generate a cover letter from a .txt file


To use these features, create a file named job_description.txt in the data_folder directory and paste your job description into it.

I also made the following improvements:

- Modified the resume style, including categorizing the Skills section

- Enhanced the prompts for both the Skills and Experience sections
